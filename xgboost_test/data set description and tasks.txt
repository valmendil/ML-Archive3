The dataset contains daily visitor data from a leisure attraction located at the border of two counties in Germany.
For some features, no description is available, so they may be dummy features (also called 1-hot encoded variables, binary indicators,...), numerical features, etc., but not categorical ones.
For the following features we provide additional information:


school holiday: 
0 = no school holiday
1 = school holiday only in county #1
2 = school holiday only in county #2
3 = school holiday both in county #1 and in county #2


bank holiday:
0 = no bank holiday
1 = bank holiday only in county #1
2 = bank holiday only in county #2
3 = bank holiday both in county #1 and in county #2


Additionally, daily weather data for the location of the leisure attraction is provided.


The task is to predict the column called 'label' for the test set.
We will measure the prediction error using the (root-)mean-squared error ((R)MSE) metric.
You may use any programming language and freely available libraries to solve this task.

An appropriate baseline will give an RMSE of approx. 500.
